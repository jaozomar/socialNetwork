# socialNetwork
Developed an extensive Java-based social network as part of a data structures class under professor Mirsaeid Abolghasemi. 
The project, completed in collaboration with three other students, involved implementing hash tables to manage user
accounts and a graph system to handle friend connections. Key features include:
  - Adding and updating profiles with usernames, images, friends, and online statuses.
  - Adding and removing friend connections, with the functionality to view all friend connections at any time.
  - Searching for profiles within the network and viewing all profiles currently in the network.
Skills enhanced: Java, data structures, object-oriented programming, and team collaboration

- The codeUML.png file shows a UML diagram of all the functions in the project.
